### Hi, I'm Yvson Nunes and I am a Computer Engineer.ðŸ¤˜

I started this journey into the world of technology with the desire to become the next Tony Stark, haha. Well, things didn't go as planned, but I haven't given up yet. I am interested in research in the area of machine learning, specifically deep learning in audio applications, particularly music information retrieval, as well as computer vision. Additionally, I also enjoy software development, specifically backend. I am also interested in embedded systems and the Internet of Things.
